It is a profound pleasure to welcome you to the modest, but beloved, amphibious hamlet of Twelve Brooks, on the very cusp of its (regionally) famous midsummer revel. You are not going to BELIEVE who they named Great Bullfrog this year. For the full Interlude, join us at patreon.com/worldsbeyondnumber",
